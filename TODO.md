# Feedback Page Addition for OpenPrep

## Information Gathered
- Use contribute page as template for form (icons, gradient card, loading spinner, simulated submission).
- Navbar has Home/Contribute links/buttons; add Feedback similarly.
- No backend; simulate submission.

## Plan
- [x] Create app/feedback/page.tsx with form (name, feature input, description textarea, submit button with icons).
- [x] Update components/navbar.tsx to include "Feedback" nav link and button (after Contribute).

## Dependent Files
- app/feedback/page.tsx (new).
- components/navbar.tsx.

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Run `npm run dev` to test.
- [ ] Verify form submission, navigation to feedback page, and responsiveness.
