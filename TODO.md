# Feedback Page Addition for OpenPrep

## Information Gathered
- Use contribute page as template for form (icons, gradient card, loading spinner, simulated submission).
- Navbar has Home/Contribute links/buttons; add Feedback similarly.
- No backend; simulate submission.

## Plan
- [x] Removed feedback feature completely as per user request (deleted app/feedback/, removed navbar links/buttons).

## Dependent Files
- app/feedback/page.tsx (new).
- components/navbar.tsx.

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Run `npm run dev` to test.
- [ ] Verify form submission, navigation to feedback page, and responsiveness.
